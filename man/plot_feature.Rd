\title{Plotting Individual Protein (Feature)}
\usage{
plot_feature(
  m,
  feature,
  feature_name_col = NULL,
  color_by = NULL,
  order_by = color_by
)
}
\arguments{
\item{m}{MSnSet or ExpressionSet object}

\item{feature}{Name of the feature to plot. Should be in featureNames(m).}

\item{feature_name_col}{Name of the column in fData(m) that
should contain name of the feature.
The default value is NULL and matches feature
against featureNames(m).}

\item{color_by}{One of the varLabels(m) that will be used to color points.
Default is no coloring.}

\item{order_by}{One of the varLabels(m) for ordering points.
Defaul is `color_by`. If no ordering desired use NULL.}
